CD27 is a key immunostimulatory molecule that enhances T cell sur- vival, activation and effector function, as well as proliferation and cytotoxic activity of NK cells. Preclinical studies demonstrate synergistic activity of PD-(L)1 blockade and varlilumab, an anti-CD27 agonist monoclonal anti- body. In an open-label Phase 2 study (NCT02335918), patients with bevaci- zumab-na√Øve, rGBM following first line chemoradiation received varlilumab (3 mg/kg, up to 16 doses) and nivolumab (240 mg) Q2W. Objectives were to determine preliminary antitumor activity based on 12-month survival rate (OS12; primary), objective response rate (ORR; iRANO), progression-free survival (PFS), as well as tolerability. 22 patients were enrolled: 23% methyl- ated MGMT (mMGMT), 68% unmethylated MGMT (uMGMT), 9% un- known; median age 58 years; 68% male; 36% ECOG performance status 0, 64% ECOG 1; 4/18 (22%) PD-L1+ tumor. Safety profile was consistent with that of each agent alone and generally grade 1-2, without dose-limiting toxicity or drug-related deaths. The most common toxicities were lympho- penia, pruritus, headache, and rash. Two patients experienced treatment- related serious events (grade 2 gait disturbance, headache and personality changes; and grade 4 thrombocytopenia). OS12 was 38.5% (95% CI; 18.6, 58.2) overall and 43.6% (95% CI; 18.2-66.7) for the uMGMT subgroup. Median OS (months) was 9.7 (95% CI; 6.7-14.8) overall and 11.3 (95% CI; 5.3, -) for the uMGMT subgroup. Eight patients (6 uMGMT, 1 mMGMT, 1 unknown) survived 12 months (range: 13.7 - 23+). Two patients (9%; both uMGMT) experienced Partial Responses (63% and 92% shrinkage) continuing at 19 and 16 months. Nine patients experienced stable disease, including 5 for 6 months (range: 7.3 - 20.3). Varlilumab with nivolumab was generally well tolerated in patients with rGBM and achieved durable therapeutic benefit in a subset of patients, although overall ORR and OS12 were similar to historical nivolumab monotherapy data. Outcome among uMGMT rGBM patients may be encouraging.

BACKGROUND: DNX-2401 (tasadenoturev) is a replication-competent, tumor-selective, oncolytic adenovirus. A dose-escalating, Phase II study of a single intratumoral injection of DNX-2401 with pembrolizumab to de- termine optimal dose, safety and efficacy is ongoing and enrolling up to 48 patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Key inclusion criteria include patients with a single lesion at first or second recurrence for which resection is not possible or planned. METHODS: In a dose-escalation design, a single intra- tumoral dose of DNX-2401 (5e8vp, 5e9vp, 5e10vp) is administered via cannula, followed 7 days later by 200 mg pembrolizumab Q3wk for up to 24 months or until confirmed progression, intolerable toxicity, or study withdrawal. Tumor response is assessed every 4 weeks for 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: As of 01May2018, 23 patients have been treated, with 17 at the optimal dose of 5e10vp DNX-2401. The median
age and KPS at entry was 52 years (26-65) and 90 (80-100), respectively. The most frequent related grade 3-4 AEs across cohorts are headache (30%), fatigue (9%), and increased GGT (9%) consistent with disease or immune activation. Transient grade 1-3 lymphopenia has also been observed. Several cases of vasogenic edema have been managed with steroid tapers or low- dose bevacizumab. No patient has died or discontinued due to study treat- ment. The median treatment duration is 5.1 months for evaluable patients treated with DNX-2401 and pembrolizumab (N=15). Preliminary efficacy includes two partial responses and 100% 9-month survival for the first 7 patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: DNX-2401 followed by pembrolizumab is well tolerated, and data emerging for disease control and survival are encouraging. Updated results will be presented.
ATIM-25. NEOADJUVANT PD-1 ANTIBODY BLOCKADE IS ASSOCIATED WITH FOCAL UPREGULATION OF PD-L1 AND CD8 T CELL INFILTRATE IN RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA

BACKGROUND: The use of anti-PD-1 therapy, pembrolizumab, has shown minimal therapeutic effect as an adjuvant treatment in glioblastoma, but its efficacy as a neoadjuvant in recurrent glioblastoma setting has yet to be established. METHODS: The Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Tri- als' Consortium conducted a randomized, multi-institution Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the immune response and survival following neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in thirty patients with recur- rent, surgically resectable glioblastoma. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was stained using multiplex immunohistochemistry to spatially visu- alize and quantify the following markers: CD8, PD-1, CD45, GFAP, and PD-L1. RESULTS: The density of tumor infiltrating CD8 T-cells was not statistically different between groups, but distinctly variable in the neo- adjuvant treatment group. PD-1 expression across both treatment groups co-localized with CD8 T-cells, though 9 neoadjuvant and only 3 adjuvant samples had appreciable PD-1 detected. Samples with the highest percentage of PD-L1 expression and double positive CD8/PD-1 cell population were present in both groups. Notable CD45/PD-L1 populations were found in 3 neoadjuvant treated samples, with only 1 in the adjuvant group. Samples were classified as having either constitutive, focal, or negative PD-L1 expres- sion pattern with varying degrees of CD8 infiltrate. 7 neoadjuvant patients and 3 adjuvant patients exhibited a focal phenotype with a high CD8 in- filtrate. Neoadjuvant samples exhibiting focal PD-L1 expression also had a higher median survival compared to the corresponding adjuvant group (p=0.035, Mantel-Cox log rank). CONCLUSION: Classification of tumors based on PD-L1, CD8, and PD-1 IHC may be predictive of outcome and therapeutic effect. We identified a subset of patients with focal expression of PD-L1 with increased survival. This suggests that focally expressed PD-L1, perhaps induced on tumor and immune infiltrate by the presence of an anti- tumor CD8 response, is a biomarker that is predictive of a positive response to anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade.

Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) is a cancer selective, retroviral replicating vector encoding a codon optimized, heat stabilized cytosine deaminase that converts Toca FC (extended-release 5- fluorocytosine, 5-FC) into the anticancer agent 5-fluorouracil. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that the Toca 511 & Toca FC regimen kills cancer cells and immunosup- pressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, leading to durable
